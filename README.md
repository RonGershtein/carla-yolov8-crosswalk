# üö¶ Crosswalk Detection in CARLA using YOLOv8

This project demonstrates a real-time crosswalk detection system in the CARLA simulator using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model.  
When a crosswalk is detected, the autonomous vehicle slows down by 50% and resumes its original speed once it has passed the crosswalk ‚Äî mimicking safe urban driving behavior.

---

## üß† How It Works

- The project runs a Tesla Model 3 in the CARLA simulation environment.
- A front-mounted RGB camera continuously captures images of the road.
- These images are processed in real time by a YOLOv8 model trained to detect crosswalks.
- If a crosswalk is detected:
  - A bounding box and label are drawn on the image.
  - A message ‚ÄúCrosswalk Ahead ‚Äì Slowing Down!‚Äù is displayed.
  - The vehicle's velocity is reduced by 50%.
- Once the crosswalk is no longer detected, the vehicle resumes its original speed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Components

- **Main.py**: Runs the live simulation, processes camera input, performs detection, and controls vehicle behavior.
- **TrainYolo.py**: Trains a YOLOv8 model using a custom dataset defined in `data.yaml`.
